# purandhar-minishell
<br>
successfully implemented a mini-shell resembling the BASH shell. Leveraging Linux Kernel System Calls and IPC mechanisms, I incorporated features such as signal handling, command history, and support for foreground (fg) and background (bg) processes. The project showcased my proficiency in string manipulation, parsing, and handling special keyboard actions like Control+C. This experience highlights my strong understanding of operating system concepts and system-level programming."
